												<h3>Travelling Salesman Problem</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The traveling salesman problem
												consists of a salesman and a set of
												cities. The salesman has to visit
												each one of the cities starting from
												a certain one (e.g. the hometown)
												and returning to the same city. The
												challenge of the problem is that
												the traveling salesman wants to
												minimize the total length of the
												trip. The steps include initialization of a population 
											    of individuals and representing each possible paths i,e sequences of
											    cities as chromosomes. The encoding used in the chromosomal representation
											    is a simple integer encoding and we perform       genetic operations like crossover,
											    mutation and selection on this population  using an appropriate fitness
				                                function. </p>

												<h3>Genealogy GWAS</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Genome-Wide Association Studies have been known to test for associations between thousands of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms(SNPs) and disease phenotypes. GWAS studies aim to identify associations of genotypes and phenotypes by testing for the differences in allele frequencies between individuals that are ancestrally similar but genetically different.

												Though GWAS has worked particularly well for common diseases it still has some pitfalls when dealing with rare diseases. Often rare diseases need to have large effect sizes to be correctly identified by GWAS studies so rare variants causing rare diseases tend to be associated with low values of statistical power. In addition to this, GWAS is also susceptible to the problem of multiple testing in which we need to account for the number of independent SNPs being tested in the study. In this study we try to improve upon the conventional GWAS method by simulating genomes of a well studied population of individuals living in the Lac-Saint-Jean Region of Quebec. The simulations are generated using an extended version of the msprime software that leverages the BALSAC French-Canadian genealogy data of more than 3 million individuals of Quebec</p>

												<h3>Deep Forests</h3>
											</header>
											<p> We use subnet structures in the form of tree blocks and aggregate them in layers to perform deep learning 
												on the dataset. The advantages of using this method is that we can select any functional set to use as nodes in the 
												trees. Genetic approaches to the optimization or training of these structures could also significantly reduce overfitting in these
												models.  The model works well specially to replicate complex functions after tuning the tree structure and the hyperparameters.
												It is promising as it captures the idea of preserving diversity in the population of individuals and helps lower the error more, without 
												falling into premature convergence.
